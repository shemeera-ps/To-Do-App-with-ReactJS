Every person has got his or her to-do list.

In the to-do list, you can properly arrange your daily life schedule. If not so, you can note down your list of goals to attain in a year or so.

To-do lists not only help you arrange your life schedules but also help you discover your unfulfilled wishes. It is not always possible to carry a pen and pencil wherever you go to note down your desires or tasks to-do list.

Here is a simple yet elegent To-do list built with React , a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
